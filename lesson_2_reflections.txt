What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git directory that contains the information needed by git to operate. This needs to be done so that git can track the history of the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a separate area from the working directory and the repository. This allows trial selection of files before a final commit takes place. Changes to the staging area can be done before making a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can stage the files that are needed to make one logical change, then make a commit. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would help keep the main branch (baseline) organized with release-only code. Any experiments and test code can be added to branches during development and only added to the main branch when ready.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The checkin diagrams show where branches start on the master branch so you can see what changes and features they contain relative to the main branch.
